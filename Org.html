<p><h4> The name of our science club is <mark>Einstein Science Club</mark></p></h4>
<br> The Science Club is a mentor based science program for both elementary and highschools</br>
<br> the club offers more than facts about science, and it also gives the opportunity to develop an</br>
<br> undestanding of the world. Science itself is fascinating and the club will help us to expand our knowledge.</br>

<mark><h3>Other Activities</h3></mark>
<br><mark> Work of eARTh</mark></br>
<br> This activity is very fun because our teacher taught us how to paint using</br>
<br> different kinds of techniques, at the same time we painted recycle plastic bottles</br>
<br> and made it as a flower pot. We did learn and enjoy making art at the same time we did help our mother nature.</br>
